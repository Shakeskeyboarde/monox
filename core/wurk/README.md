# Wurk

Wurk is a declarative, extensible build system for monorepos or single packages.

- Run one command per logical task.
- Leverage the power of community with custom commands.
- Orchestrate tasks across multiple interrelated workspaces.
- Stay flexible and transparent without adding complexity.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/) is required.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is required.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is recommended but optional
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is recommended but optional.

## Getting Started

Install Wurk and any [commands](#commands) you want as a dev dependencies of your project root.

```sh
npm install --save-dev wurk @wurk/command-build
```

Run a Wurk command. For example the [build](https://npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-build) command (installed above) will automatically invoke Rollup, Vite, TypeScript, and/or TypeDoc, based on the presence of configuration files for each of these tools.

```sh
npx wurk build
```

(Optional) Install Wurk globally to avoid having to use `npx`. When `wurk` is executed, it delegates to the locally installed version, so `wurk build` becomes equivalent to `npx wurk build`.

```sh
npm install --global wurk
```

(Optional) Delegate root workspace NPM scripts to Wurk. This keeps your package scripts clean and allows developers to use NPM commands instead of invoking Wurk directly.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wurk build",
    "test": "wurk test",
    "create-release": "wurk version auto",
    "release": "wurk publish",
    "clean": "wurk clean"
  }
}
```

## Commands

The following "official" commands are available.

- [build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-build): Run Rollup, Vite, TypeScript, and TypeDoc.
- [test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-test): Run Depcheck, ESLint, and Vitest.
- [version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-version): Set, increment, promote, and conventionally auto generate versions.
- [publish](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-publish): Publish or pack packages.
- [run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-run): Run package scripts.
- [exec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-exec): Run executables.
- [clean](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-clean): Remove Git ignored files, but leave dependencies and dotfiles alone.
- [list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wurk/command-list): List workspaces.

Run `npm install --save-dev @wurk/command-<name>` in your project root to install any of these commands.

See the [API docs](./docs/api/README.md) for information on creating your own custom commands.

## Options

Wurk has global options for selection, parallelization, logging, etc.

These options are "global" because they are defined by Wurk itself. Commands can also define their own options. In general, global options should precede the command name, and command options should follow the command name. Most commands will allow Wurk to handle global options that follow the command name, but this is not guaranteed.

```sh
wurk [global-options] <command> [command-options]
```

### Selection Options

Options which reduce the number of workspaces that are processed.

- `-w, --workspace <query>`
  - Select workspaces by name, privacy, keyword, or directory.
  - Use `private:true` or `private:false` to select private or public workspaces.
  - Use `keyword:<pattern>` to select workspaces by keyword (glob supported).
  - Use `dir:<pattern>` to select workspaces by directory (glob supported).
  - Use `name:<pattern>` or just `<pattern>` to select workspaces by name (glob supported).
  - Prefix any query with `not:` to exclude instead of include.
  - Use a leading ellipsis to (eg. `...<query>`) to also match dependencies.
  - Use a trailing ellipsis to (eg. `<query>...`) to also match dependents.
- `--include-root-workspace`
  - Include the root workspace in the selection. _This is strongly discouraged due to the potential for unexpected behaviors like accidental recursion!_

### Parallelization Options

- `-p, --parallel`
  - Process workspaces in parallel.
  - This option implies the `--concurrency=auto` option.
- `-c, --concurrency <count>`
  - Set the number workspaces to process in parallel. The count can be a number, "auto", or "all". The default is is "auto", which is equivalent to one greater than the number of CPU cores (cores + 1).
  - This option implies the `--parallel` option.

> By default, workspaces are processed serially (one at a time). This is generally the slowest option, but also the safest.

### Logging Options

- `--loglevel <level>`
  - Set the log level (`silent`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `notice`, `verbose`, or `silly`). The default is `info`.
  - Log level can also be set using the `WURK_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. The command line option takes precedence over the environment variable.
- `--clear`
  - Clear the screen on startup. This does the same thing as the linux `clear` command, but is more CI friendly. It does not error if it is not available or `TERM` is not set, and it respects TTY availability.
